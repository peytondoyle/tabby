# Tabby — Epic Tracker

This file tracks **phases, epics, tasks, and prompts** for AI agents (Cursor/Claude).  
Each task is atomic, testable, and composable.

## ✅ Phase 0 — Supabase Setup & Environment
- [x] **Environment**: Create `.env.example` and validate required variables.
- [x] **Preflight**: Add `scripts/preflight.mjs` to check env vars on startup.
- [x] **Supabase CLI**: Install and configure `supabase/config.toml`.
- [ ] **Project Link**: Link local project to remote Supabase instance.
- [x] **Migrations**: Create and apply database schema migrations.
- [x] **RLS Policies**: Enable Row Level Security on all tables.
- [x] **Storage Buckets**: Create `receipts` (private) and `thumbs` (signed) buckets.
- [ ] **Seeds**: Add sample data for development/testing.

## ✅ Phase 1 — Foundations & Core Data
- [x] **Schema**: Create Supabase migrations for `bills`, `people`, `items`, `item_shares`, `bill_groups`, `bill_group_members`, `trips`.
- [x] **Scaffold**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- [x] **Supabase client**: `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
- [x] **Routing**: React Router with `/bill/:id` and `/share/:id`.
- [x] **Layout**: AppShell with header + 3-column grid (desktop), stacked mobile.

- [ ] Add Jest unit tests (simple, shared, even, couple, rounding cases).

---

## ⏳ Phase 5 — OCR & Parsing
- [ ] `<UploadPanel />` for file input + preview.
- [ ] `/api/ocr` Vercel route calling Google Vision.
- [ ] `parseReceipt()` function: cluster lines, detect items/subtotal/tax/tip, assign confidence.
- [ ] Confirm Screen: editable table, warnings, overlay on receipt image/PDF.
- [ ] Persist accepted results to Supabase.

---

## ⏳ Phase 6 — Shareable Exports
